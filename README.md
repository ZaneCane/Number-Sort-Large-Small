# Number-Sort-Large-Small
I have created a program in JGrasp that should find the largest and smallest number in a text file called Numbers.txt

This file holds  5 numbers 
8.7
7.9
3.0
9.2
-99
12.6

The -99 is supposed to stop the program from reading any further. 
Once the program reaches -99 the program should display the largest & smallest numbers.
That is the problem. The program will not display the any numbers. If anyone knows a simple solution to this problem please let me know

Thank you for reading this post.
